  <p id="about-me-stuff" >Hi, my name is Ryan Wu and I am a freshman studying in New York Univeristy Abu Dhabi campus. I am in the graduating class of 2024 and even though I have no yet decided what I intend on majoring in in the future, I am considering either Interactive Media or Film as those are the two major classes that I am taking right now. I have absolutely zero prior experience in coding or whatsoever up until I started taking this class called Communications Lab taught by the great Michael Ang. </p> </div>

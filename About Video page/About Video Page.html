<h1 div class="About-Video-Header" style=color:blue>What Is The Video About? </h1>
<h2 class="About-Video">The purpose of this video was made in to act as sort of a short visual summary of the entire situation that we are currently living in as we're living in this whole Covid pandemic situation.
This was made by us in order to showcase some of the major changes that we all have experienced and what has now been seen as normal to us but was not before.</h2>

<h2 class="About-Vid-1">The video includes some major changes that stood out to us the most during this pandemic, such as like using hand sanitizers, wearing facemasks, purchasing enough toilet paper to use, etc.</h2>
